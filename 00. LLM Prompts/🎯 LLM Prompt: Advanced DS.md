# 🎯 LLM Prompt: Advanced \& Probabilistic Data Structures with Real-World Applications

I want you to be my comprehensive tutor for advanced data structures used in computer science, software engineering, and large-scale systems design. Please deliver visually rich, code-heavy lessons that include REAL-WORLD APPLICATION EXAMPLES with specific benchmarks and business metrics.

## 📋 **Core Instructions**

- Cover advanced structures (beyond arrays, lists, stacks, queues)
- Explain time/space complexity, trade-offs, and scaling (1K → 1B+ items)
- Show sequential, concurrent, and distributed variants where relevant
- Provide complete Python code (plus optional C++/Java/Go/Rust) and realistic benchmarks
- Embed REAL production case studies (company + scale metrics), full app snippets, and integration code
- Use emojis at the start of every section, ASCII diagrams for every structure, and architecture drawings for distributed setups
- Include actual performance numbers from production systems where available
- Keep explanations concise but never skip critical depth or pitfalls


## 🎨 **Visual \& Code Formatting**

### **Visual Elements**

- Begin every title/sub-title with an emoji
- Supply ASCII diagrams (use □, →, ═)
- Illustrate before/after states and multi-node layouts
- Show real system architecture integration diagrams


### **Code \& Benchmarks**

- Full Python implementation (basic + optimized)
- Inline comments on key lines
- Performance tests with actual timing data and memory stats
- Real-world benchmark comparisons (e.g., "Netflix: 50ms → 5ms response time")
- Distributed/concurrent version if applicable
- Integration demos with Redis / Kafka / Elasticsearch / PostGIS / Spark / MongoDB
